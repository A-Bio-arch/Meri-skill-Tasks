Virtual Internship at Meriskill!
Welcome to the repository documenting my virtual internship at Meriskill! This productive journey involved working on two distinct tasks using Python and exploring various datasets. The tasks focused on predictive analysis in the healthcare domain and human resources (HR) attrition data analysis.

Task 1: Diabetes Prediction Analysis
In the first task, I delved into Diabetes prediction analysis using Python. The process included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset thoroughly. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, I implemented predictive models to forecast diabetes occurrences. The Python programming language served as the primary tool for this task.

Task 2: HR Attrition Data Analysis
The second task revolved around the analysis of HR attrition data. Using Jupyter Notebook, I explored various steps to gain insights into employee attrition within the organization. This task aimed to understand patterns, identify potential factors influencing attrition, and provide actionable recommendations.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured to keep task-related files and datasets organized. The Diabetes_Prediction and HR_Attrition_Analysis folders contain task-specific code and related resources.

Getting Started
To replicate the analyses or explore the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/meriskill-virtual-internship.git
Navigate to the specific task folder.
Open the Jupyter Notebook using a compatible environment.
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (if applicable).
Acknowledgments
I express my gratitude to Meriskill for providing this virtual internship opportunity. The experience enhanced my Python skills and allowed me to apply machine learning and data analysis techniques to real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore the code and datasets, and don't hesitate to reach out for any questions or collaborations!
